Good evening everybody!

This weekend we wil be looking at the book of Revelation.

And I really love this book for a number of reasons.

And a 'revelation' is, well, sort of just what it says. It's a revealing. Or another way to translate the word from Greek is as an 'unveiling'. And this, book, specifically, is an unveiling of *all reality*.

Because, as we know, there is a world around us with all sorts of stuff going on, and the question is : how do we make sense of it? Wars and Greenland and AI and climate change and friends and school and family and arguments and work and struggles and joys and our own hearts, and our own minds and identities. Each day we wake up probably eat some food and go somewhere and speak to other humans and think about a thousand things, and walk down the street and get back into our beds and do it all again, on and on and on.

But behind our everyday lives, behind everything that happens on the earth around us and behind everything that happens to us, and behind everything we ourselves do - there is a *spiritual* reality. And it is this reality which we cannot see with our earthly eyes, and so it needs to be unveiled for us : revealed for us - those*cosmic* events, those *eternal* events that make up our day to day lives.

And I think we need this especially today because, you don't need me to tell you this, there are so many voices around us. With the internet and  absolute *mess* of conflicting and contradicting values and ideas. And, you know, there are good things, true things in the various voices of our society, but they're just bits and pieces. What *we* need, if we want a way to live, what we need is the eagle-eye view, the grand narrative of heaven and earth. And it is by this view of the world, this 'worldview', this *true* worldview, that we can keep following Jesus until He comes back.
 
And, even more than all this, Satan, also, is *actively* seeking to deceive us. He is actively trying to *feed* and *influence* our worldviews away from what is true, away from what is good. 
 
The aim of this book, of this weekend, and I pray that the Lord will help us all in this, is that our worldviews would begin to be shaped more and more by what is actually true. And the way in which Revelation communicates truth to us is kind of weird. It's not the sort of stuff we're used to reading, generally. 
 
But we're going to see, as we read this book, that we are being invited by Jesus to enter into a world of symbols and images, a lot of it based on the Old Testament. We're being invited to see the earth from His heavenly perspective. And so, as we read, Jesus comes to the Apostle John in a vision. And John, at Jesus' command, writes it down for us. Look at v11 :

*"Write on a scroll what you see 
and send it to the seven churches"*

Sometimes people treat Revelation like a secret message to be decoded - but actually, first and foremost, it's a *letter*. Send it to the seven churches! There are all these symbolic pictures and numbers and characters, and because it all seems a bit obscure we just assume that it's something we have to decipher and work out or, more likely, it's not worth bothering. 

But, like, it's obviously not *meant* to be confusing. The original churches receiving this letter weren't sent it by Jesus justs to confuse them. John writes this letter to *comfort* them, and to challenge them. But not to confuse them. And, you know, we don't know our Old Testaments as well as they did, and so we're going to have to do a bit more work in order to understand. But the *purpose* for us is the same. We have Revelation because we need help and encouragment to keep following Jesus, even in the face of hardship. We have Revelation because our worldviews need to be challenged, and we need to live according to what is true, not just what society *says* is true.

Once we get over the slightly strange imagery, actually this is just a letter this is *full* of love. Just hear it in v9 : 

*"I, John, your brother 
and [your] companion 
in the suffering 
and kingdom 
and patient endurance 
that are ours in Jesus"*

We learn that John writes from a place of exile, on this island called Patmos, in Greece. He's been put there, he says in v9 still *"because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus"*. Because he held firm to his faith, he is now suffering. And he's writing this letter to a variety of churches in various situations, some of which are also suffering persecution. Some of which are at risk of compromising with the world, we'll think about that a bit more. But, wherever they're at, Jesus wants all of them, and we need this too, in His love He just wants all of them know what is *true*.  In His love He wants us to know what is true.

Because the whole point of getting our worldview into shape, is that we would know that, even when things seem weak and hopeless and grey and dull and impossible and it would just make so much sense, and be so much easier to compromise with the world, to deny Jesus, to give into temptation, that there is actually *another* perspective of reality, where weakness is strength and death is life, and persecution is victory and a cross is a throne. 

Jesus wants to give us images and pictures and ideas that supercede what we think we're seeing.

I mean John says this here, right?

*"I, John, your brother 
and [your] companion 
**in the suffering**"*

John and the Christians are suffering.
But what does he then say next?

*"I, John, your brother
and [your] companion 
in the suffering
**and [the] kingdom**"*

In Jesus' heavenly perspective, these things are not seperate. Suffering and kingdom seem like a strange pairing. But as we layer the heavenly perspective on top of the earthly one, we're going to see that these points overlap. They're the same thing. 

Right now, we have the earthly perspective, we need the heavenly one. If we want to understand properly the earthly, we need the fuller picture that the heavenly vision gives. This why we have the book of Revelation.

We read out this whole passage, and obviously there's already a lot going on. It's late, I've been at work all week - I won't try and unpack it all here. Please, please, come chat to me afterwards if you want to. But I'll just make this last point.

##things that are now, and will be?
