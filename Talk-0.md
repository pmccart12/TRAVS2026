Good evening everybody!

Yeah so, so I'm Peter.

And, as mentioned, I work as an engineer. Which is really fun. And lots of us will be in school or some sort of training or whatever it is. And each of us has our own world, right? We 

Because we're looking at Revelation this weekend, and... has anyone here read Revelation before, even just bits of it? *Let them respond*

Yeah so, if you've ever come across this book right at the end of the Bible before, then you'll know that it's full of crazy images and weird creatures and it *is* a little bit strange. But, what we're going to learn, is that these images, these weird creatures, they're actually real.

Okay, there aren't necessarily seven-headed leopards and speaking sheep roaming about the earth, but what Jesus is doing in this book for us is this : He constructs for us a sort of symbolic world that we can enter into, and inhabit. A world full of visual language and deep Biblical ideas. And, actually, this world, we're going to see, is not an alien world, because it's *our* world.

Because a 'revelation' is, well, sort of just what it says. It's a revealing. Or another way to translate the word in v1 is as an 'unveiling', and it's an unveiling of *all reality*.

Because behind great world events, wars and AI and climate change and pandemics, but also behind our lives, behind the smallest everyday things, and family and friends and struggles and joys. Behind everything that happens to us, and behind everything *we ourselves* do - there is a *spiritual* reality. There is a heavenly reality behind everything. And it is *this* reality which we cannot see with our earthly eyes, and so it needs to be unveiled for us : revealed for us - these*cosmic* events, these *eternal* events that make up our everyday lives.

And Revelation is going to give us the images and the symbols in order to see and understand this cosmic, this heavenly, reality behind everything. 

And we've already started - I mean, in the reading we just had there was Jesus -  but He had like burning eyes and swords coming out of His mouth and metal feet, and we sort of *do* get the vibe - this is the risen Lord Jesus, Who once was dead but is now alive, and He is powerful, and He is glorious. But if I'm honest, this isn't, generally, the sort of stuff that I'm used to reading. It's still a little bit strange, and that can be confusing and offputting.

But I suppose that the hope is, this weekend, that all of us *will* begin to get used to these images. That we'll accept Jesus' invitation to step further into this symbolic world that is actually our world. We are, by no means, going to be able to read the whole book; we've only really got a couple days. But I suppose that my prayer for all of us is that we'll all be able to go home after this and pick up our Bibles and turn right to the back, to Revelation, and not just think 'this is weird and confusing, I'm just going to read something else'. Because Jesus thinks it's *so* important that we understand this book.

He sends this *letter* for a reason. Did you see that, in v11?

*"Write on a scroll what you see [, figures, images,]
and **send** it to the seven churches"*

Sometimes people treat Revelation like a secret puzzle to be decoded, you know, let's work out if Donald Trump is the Antichrist or if we've reached the fourth stage of the End Times or whatever. And I'm not saying these aren't important questions, but before we get into the details, we have to remember that, first and foremost, it is a *letter*. Send it to the seven churches!

Because, like, obviously the original churches receiving this letter weren't sent it by Jesus just to confuse them. John writes it to *comfort* them, and to *challenge* them. But not to confuse them. 

A lot of the images in this book are based on the Old Testament, and we obviously don't know our Old Testaments as well as they did, and so we're going to have to do a bit more work in order to understand. But the *purpose* for us is just the same. *We*, right now, have been given Revelation because *we* need help and we need encouragment to keep following Jesus, even in the face of hardship. We've been given Revelation because our worldviews need to be challenged, and we need to live according to what is true, not just what society says is true. The temptation to compromise with the world is real. But when we know what is true, when we have the heavenly perspective, it becomes a lot easier to fight against the lies of the world, against the lies of Satan.

And once we get over the slightly strange imagery, actually this is a letter that is just *full* of love. Just hear it in v9 : 

*"I, John, your **brother** 
and [your] companion 
in the suffering 
and kingdom 
and patient endurance 
that are ours in Jesus"*

We learn that John writes from a place of exile, he's on this island called Patmos, in Greece. He's been put there, he says in v9 still *"because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus"*. Because he held firm to his faith, he is now suffering. And he's writing this letter to a variety of churches in various situations, some of which are also suffering persecution. Some of which are at risk of compromising with the world. But, wherever they're at, Jesus sends John this vision because He wants all of these churches, and we need this too, in His love He just wants all of them know what is *true*.  In His love He wants us to know what is true.

Because the whole point of getting our worldview into shape, in focussing it on the truth, however weird it might look, is that we would know that, even when things seem weak and hopeless and grey and dull and impossible and it would just make so much sense, and be so much easier to compromise with the world, to go our own way, and give up the testimony of Jesus, that there is actually *another* perspective of reality, where weakness is strength and death is life, and persecution is victory and a cross is a throne. 

Jesus wants to give us images and pictures and ideas that supercede what we think we're seeing with our eyes.

I mean John says this here, right?

*"I, John, your brother 
and [your] companion 
**in the suffering**"*

John and the Christians are suffering, that's what they're seeing.
But what does he then say next?

*"I, John, your brother
and [your] companion 
in the suffering
**and [the] kingdom**"*

In Jesus' heavenly perspective, these things are not seperate. We see suffering; He sees a kingdom. And as we begin to layer His heavenly perspective on top of our earthly one, we're going to see that these points overlap. They're not mutually exclusive.

We read out this whole passage, and obviously there's already a lot going on. It's late, I've been at work all week - I won't try and unpack it all here. Please, and this goes for the whole weekend by the way, but please, come chat to me afterwards if you want to. But I'll just make this last point.

Sometimes people make out that Revelation is *just* about the End Times, about the days just before Jesus returns. But, actually, what we miss, is that we're *in* the End Times now. Sometimes people try to construct calendars and timelines about which events happen when and in which order as they unfold in this book. But Revelation is more of a spiral than a straight line. It presents the same events again and again, just in different ways and with slightly different images. But if you want a linear timeline of history, we have Jesus' resurrection, the 'End Times', Jesus' return. And because we're in the End Times now, this means that we read Revelation not as a sort of birdspotters guide, trying to figure out exactly which 

Just look at v19 :

*"Write, therefore, what you have seen, 
what is now and what will take place later."*

Revelation is teaching us, first, about *what is **now***. About me and you and the whole world *now*. About the reality of everything in the time between Jesus' resurrection and Jesus' return. And then also, yes, about things that will *"take place later"*.
