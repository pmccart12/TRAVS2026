Good evening everybody!

Have you guys heard of the mantis shrimp? This is what they look like [show slide]. And they're very pretty creatures but, apparently, maybe you already know this, they can see, like, millions of more colours than we can. And, as I was deep in the Wikipedia rabbit hole, I was just thinking to myself, 'what if, one moment, I just became a mantis shrimp?'. Would the world around me just transform into all sorts of different hues and shades I'd never known existed? It would be kind of shocking, but also probably really beautiful. And that's kind of what the book of Revelation is doing.

Because a 'revelation' is, well, sort of just what it says. It's a revealing. An unveiling.

Look right at the start, 1v1 :
 
*"The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place."*

Jesus wants to show us something!

And I don't know, maybe you've come across this book before - it's right at the end of the Bible. And it's sort of known for being a bit wild.  Because it is *full* of crazy images and weird creatures, talking sheep and seven-headed leopards, and to be fair it *is* a little bit strange. But, what we're going to see, hopefully, over these couple days, is that it changes completely how we see the world.

Because behind great world events, wars and AI and climate change and pandemics, but also behind our lives, behind the smallest everyday things, school and family and friends and struggles and joys. Behind everything that happens to us, and behind everything *we ourselves* do - there is a *spiritual* reality. There is a heavenly reality behind everything. And it is *this* reality which we cannot see, yet, with our earthly eyes, and so it needs to be unveiled for us : revealed for us. Because what we're going to see is that our everyday lives are *full* of big and epic, and *colourful*  things. Our lives *really* matter.

And, to show us this, Jesus, in this book, is going to give us *images*.

And we've already started - I mean, in the reading we just had there was Jesus -  but He had like burning eyes and swords coming out of His mouth and metal feet, and we sort of get the vibe, right? - this is the risen Lord, Who once was dead but is now alive, and He is powerful, and He is glorious, and He has come to be with His people.

But if we're honest, this isn't, generally, the sort of stuff that we're used to reading. It's still a little bit strange. I know I certainly find it tricky.

But what Jesus is doing for us is this : He is inviting us to enter into His heavenly perspective. Because Jesus is like a spiritual mantis shrimp. There are things He can see, from heaven, that we can't. But it's okay, because He's going to show us. In this book of Revelation, He is going to teach us to see the world through His eyes.

We're not going to be able to read the whole book; we've only really got a couple days. But I suppose that my prayer for all of us is that we'll *let* Him teach us. Because Jesus thinks that it's *so* important that we understand this letter.

Did you see that, in v11? Look at it with me.

*"Write on a scroll what you see
and **send** it to the seven churches"*

Sometimes people treat Revelation like a secret puzzle to be decoded, you know, like a Rubix cube of strange pictures. And there *are* lots of important questions to be asked, but before we get into all the nitty-gritty details, we're going to have to remember that, first and foremost, this is a *letter*. Send it to the seven churches!

We're going to see lots of symbolic numbers in this book, but one of the most important ones is 7. It's a prime number which is pretty cool - but even more than that, in the Bible it often represents fulness and completion. There are literally 7 churches referrenced here. But it *also* means, the fulness of the church, every believer throughout all time and space. So, guys, Revelation... is addressed to us. We've got a letter direct from the risen Lord Jesus. Not a Rubix cube, but a letter. And He's going to show us what's true.

A lot of the images Jesus uses in this book are based on the Old Testament, and we obviously don't know our Old Testaments as well as they did, and so we're going to have to do a bit more work in order to understand. But the *purpose* for us is just the same.

Because in life there's always going to be this temptation to follow what the world does, to follow what the world *sees*. Popularity and money and good looks and whatever. But Jesus wants to show us *His* perspective, because He, more than anyone, can actually see what is *true*. And when we know what is true, when we have the heavenly perspective, it becomes a lot easier to resist the lies of the world, and to resist the lies of Satan.

And so Jesus is going to give us images and pictures and ideas that I guess sort of enhance what we're looking at. Sort of like spiritual x-ray vision!

Because, actually, if we can't see the heavenly reality behind the earthly reality, it can be really hard to have hope. I mean we read it here in v9. Look at it with me.

*"I, John, your brother 
and [your] companion 
**in the suffering**..."*

We learn that John writes from this island called Patmos, in Greece. Which maybe initially sounds like quite a nice holiday, but then we learn that he's actually in *exile* there. He's been banished from his friends and family, he says in v9 still *"because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus"*. Because he held firm to his faith, he is now suffering. And he's writing to other churches that are suffering too.

They're suffering, that's what they're *seeing*.
But what does he then say next? Look at v9 again :

*"I, John, your brother
and [your] companion 
in the suffering
**and [the] kingdom**..."*

In Jesus' heavenly perspective, behind the suffering of these Christians... there is a kingdom, and it is glorious. But we're going to think a lot more about that tomorrow.

And so, just as we close. Just to take with us to think about this evening - the *main* aim, as we read this letter, the main aim, is for us to start to to see reality how Jesus sees reality. We want to see reality how Jesus sees reality. He's going to help, He's going to unveil it for us in this book, as He shows us what is actually true. We're going to see that the Christian life is *exciting*. It's vivid and bold. And, following Him is rich and beautiful. So this weekend, as you eat and and talk and think and play games and chat with one another, just try and immerse yourself in these images in Revelation. It's reality through Jesus' eyes. And He wants us to see.

Let me pray.
