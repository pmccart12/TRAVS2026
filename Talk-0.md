Good evening everybody!

This weekend we wil be looking at the book of Revelation.

And a 'revelation' is, well, sort of just what it says. It's a revealing. Or another way to translate the word in Greek is as an 'unveiling'. And this, book, specifically, is an unveiling of *all reality*.

There is a world around us with all sorts of stuff going on, how do we make sense of it all? Wars and Greenland and AI and climate change and friends and school and work and struggles and joys and our own hearts and minds and identities. Each day we wake up and probably, in no specific order, eat some food and go somewhere and speak to other humans and think about a thousand things, and walk down the street and get back into our beds and do it all again, on and on and on.

But, behind our everyday lives, behind everything that happens on the earth around us, there is something more which needs to be unveiled for us, something more which needs to be revealed. We can understand the world, and ourselves, through our earthly perspective, but there is also a heavenly perspective. And we're going to see in this book that heaven's perspective is full and sometimes scary, but also rich and beautiful and, most importantly, it's true. It's the true perspective.

Because, actually, we say that we have our earthly eyes, but not all human perspectives are the same. Everyone has, what we often call, a 'worldview' - a way in which we understand and interpret and *view* the world around us.
 
And our worldviews are influenced by our our experiences, and our language, and the society around us, and all sorts. But, actually, these things aren't always accurate. Our experiences are only part of a picture, our thoughts and feelings can lie to us. And you don't need me to tell you that society around is just an absolute *mess* of conflicting and contradicting values and ideas. How do we make sense of it all?
 
Because, even more than all this, Satan, also, is *actively* seeking to deceive us. He is actively trying to *feed* and *influence* our worldviews away from what is true, and good. 
 
The aim of this book, of this weekend, and I pray that the Lord will help us all in this, is that our worldviews would begin to be shaped more and more by what is actually true. And the way in which Revelation does this for us is kind of weird. It's not the sort of stuff we're used to reading, generally. 
 
We're going to see, as we read this book, that we are being invited by Jesus to enter into His world of symbols and images, we're being invited to see the earth from His heavenly perspective. 

Because Revelation *is* a letter, by the way, if I hadn't mentioned that already. Look at v11 :

*"Write on a scroll what you see 
and send it to the seven churches"*

Sometimes people treat Revelation like a secret message to be decoded. There are all these symbolic pictures and numbers and characters, and because it all seems a bit obscure we just assume that it's something we have to work out. But, actually, it's not meant to be confusing. The original churches receiving this letter weren't sent it by Jesus to confuse them. John writes this letter to *comfort* them, and to challenge them. But not to confuse them. Because we don't know our Old Testaments as well as they did we're going to have to do a bit more work than they might've done in order to understand. But the purpose for us is the same. We have Revelation because we need help and encouragment to keep following Jesus. We have Revelation because our worldviews need to be challenged, and we need to live according to what is true, not just what society *says* is true.
