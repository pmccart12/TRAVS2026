Good morning everyone!

Okay, so, we're in the final parts of Revelation.

Already, we've seen the throne of God in heaven, from which the risen Lamb rules all of creation.

We've seen how, as He died and rose from the dead, that dragon, Satan, was struck, and cast down to the earth, no longer able to accuse us of our guilt.

And we've seen how, now that he knows he has lost the war, he roams the earth attempting to persecute and destroy the Church, but God's protection is over His people in the wilderness.

What is in heaven is what is actually real, that Christ reigns and we are safe with Him and Satan is defeated. And, now, in these final chapters, it's what we've been saying, now what is true in heaven *will* become true on earth. *This* is the great promise of Jesus in the book of Revelation. And so, as people now not yet there, as God's Church wandering in the wilderness, pursued by the Dragon, let's take what we've just read as a promise, as Biblical hope. Hope in what is inevitable, because these things are already true in heaven. We're not yet there but, if we hold on, if we hold to the testimony of Jesus, if we endure, if we resist Satan and temptation, we will be there. Remember that scroll with seven seals we heard about yesterday morning? The scroll containing all of God's promises? Well, today we're on the final seal; the promises are about to be fulfilled.

So, first, let's deal with the Dragon.

*"When the thousand years are over, [these thousand years are the same as those three and half years, or 1260 days from yesterday evening. They're just another symbolic way of talking about the time between Jesus' resurrection and His return. So the time we're in now.], 

[When the thousand years are over,] 
Satan will be released from his prison
[Satan, in a sense, is currently restrained. Remember we read yesterday, he wants to destroy to the Church, but Jesus won't let him. So he's restrained; he's in prison.]

[So, when the thousand years are over,
Satan will be released from his prison]
and will go out to deceive the nations 
in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—
and to gather them for **battle**. 
In number they are like the sand on the seashore.

They marched across the breadth of the earth 
and surrounded the camp of God’s people, 
the city He loves. "*

So, at the End of Days, the Devil, and the people that he has led astray, will muster themselves to war against the people of God, one final battle. This is Avengers : Endgame. On one side, we have the Dragon, and all those who align themselves with him. Here they're referred to as 'Gog and Magog' which is just a reference to Ezekiel. But, simply, these are those that oppose Christ.

And then, on the other side, we have the camp of the people of God. And just picture it, all the armies of the earth gathered together against one small camp in the wilderness. It doesn't look hopeful. But, of course, as readers of Revelation, we know that the way things appear on earth is not always the whole story. Because this pitiful camp is actually a city, it says in v9. We learnt yesterday that the ragged woman fleeing in the wilderness is actually a heavenly princess. The persecuted Church on earth is actually victorious in heaven. And this camp is a city. Though it may look weak, it is strong, it is enduring, and it is *loved*, it says here, by the God of all creation who sits on the throne. So what happens? We heard it read - God's fire of judgement comes from heaven, and the Dragon, and all of his followers, are consumed, and . And the camp, the city, of God's people stands firm.

What is true in heaven will become true on earth, and Satan is now defeated on earth. That scroll is opening, and it cannot be stopped. 

If we cast, again, our minds back to yesterday morning, to the throne of God. And we had those twenty-four elders, and the four living creatures in 

The world around us says to us that the reason why we exist, the point of living, the point of existing, it to make ourselves happy. It's to find some sort of self-assurance or self-satisfaction. Our society tells us, in one way or another, that we exist for ourselves, and what *we* decide is valuable. And if that's how we approach the world, if that's how we approach the idea of Hell, then of course it's going to sound terrible. 'Why does God have the right to punish *me*, or anyone else, for not obeying Him? My life is my own, and I owe Him nothing, and I never asked to be created.'

But actually we *know* why we were created. We heard it back in chapters 4 and 5. Those concentric circles around the throne of God. The 24 elders and the 4 living creatures and all the angels of heaven and every created thing. What were they doing? *Let people respond*

They were *worshipping* God. They were praising Him. Everything has been made to honour Him. To have life *means* to join in with that worship. And when we don't, when we excuse ourselves from those circles of praise, we're excusing ourselves from the reason for our existance. People talk about Hell and eternal punishment as if it's unjust, but really it's just what we asked for. We asked to be excluded from worshipping and obeying and loving our Creator, from loving Jesus. 'No thanks! I'll be alright on my own! I don't need any Lamb's blood' Well God let's us go out on our own, and we find that, beyond the city of God, there is only oblivion. 

And so *that's* why Jesus, here, wants us, needs us, to know this. It's a warning! These parts of the Bible aren't there to scare us, to frighten us into submission. They're there to warn us not to believe Satan's lies. They're there to warn us that when we align ourselves with him, in the end, this is what it looks like, death and fire and sulphur. Okay, Revelation is a book of symbols, of images. But whether or not Hell is literally flames everywhere is sort of beside the point. The *image* is clear, the reality behind eternal seperation from God, eternal exclusion from those ranks of worshippers - it might as well be fire and ashes.

There's so much that could be said about this, I recognise that this is kind of heavy on a Sunday morning, and we've not spent very long on it. It may've opened lots of questions and concerns, and obviously there's not enough time right now to think it all through. So, as ever, chat to one of the leaders or me after or at any point in the future. I don't think that anyone, Christian or otherwise, finds the idea of Hell easy to think about. I mean, it is tragic. But, remember, it's also not the whole story.

Because after Satan has been thrown into the lake of fire, and after everyone who has rejected the Lamb is thrown there too, and all the forces of evil and chaos and rebellion have been done away with once and for all, John receives the next part of the vision. ch21v1.

*"Then... I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea [and v5]... He who was seated on the throne said, “[Behold,] I am making [all things] new!” "**

In lots of ways, Revelation is not a happy book. It's full of dangers and warnings and horrible dragons and persecuted Christians and, we didn't read a lot of this, but also full of plagues and bloody wars and death and woe and you sort of just read it and think 'blimey, it just keeps going on and on and spiralling around and around into heavier and heavier things'. But, all throughout the book, there are these little statements every now and then, that just keep pointing us to the end. 

Because after all the weariness of these thousand years fleeing and fighting Satan, suffering and sorrowing, *now* our Lord Jesus shall make everything new. If we endure to the end, if we triumph by the blood of the Lamb and by holding to the testimony of Jesus, even to the point of physical death. By His resurrection our names are written in the book of life, then all the struggling will end just as He has promised. ch21v3:

*“Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, 
and He will dwell with them. 
They will be His people, 
and God Himself will be with them 
and be their God. 
‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. 
There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, 
for the old order of things has passed away.”*

[*"God Himself will be with them 
and be their God. 
‘[And] He will wipe every tear from their eyes. 
... 
for the old order of things has passed away.”*]

The big question for the Christians then, as it is us for us now, is this : 'is it worth it?' Is it worth enduring? Submitting to the world, giving into temptation, compromising with society, these would be so much easier to do. 

Following Jesus means being enlisted for war, it puts us in the Dragon's sights. We become one of his targets when we put our trust in Jesus. But the resounding answer to 'is it worth it?' is of course 'yes'.

*"To the thirsty I will give water without cost [, Jesus says in v6,]
from the spring of the water of life. 
[And] those who are victorious will inherit all this, 
and I will be their God 
and they will be My children."*

This is true now we can come to the Lamb for living water even now. But how wonderful, how utterly wonderful, that the peace and the life and the comfort and the fellowship that we receive from Him now is even only just a taste, of the rest and the vigour and the delight and the communion with Him that we shall have as, in the New Jerusalem, that City of God, we shall drink *deeply* of those crystal waters of life. There is a whole world to overcome. There are all the demonic forces of darkness and malice to conquer. But if we refuse to compromise our faith, if we refuse to forsake the Lamb that was slain for us, that Lamb that reigns from the centre of the universe, then we shall shall inherit all of these things. He has paid for it with His own blood, He can offer us water without cost. He's the only One who can. We can go to no one else.

As we wrap up this book of Revelation, I hope it has been helpful to you. I pray that, as we've looked at these images and symbols together, that they can become part of our worldview, part of how we think about reality and ourselves and history and those around us and the future. I hope they give you encouragement to keep going follow Jesus, to keep resisting the temptation to compromise with the world, to keep resisting Satan and fighting sin. And I just pray that we remember that these things are true. This is what is real. This is what real. Let me pray that our Father would help us with these things.
