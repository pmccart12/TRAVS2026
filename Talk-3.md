Good morning everyone!

How do you think the world is going to end? Because back in the day, I reckon the 'the big three'  were : nuclear war, climate change, or a giant meteor. But I also reckon that in the past few years we've had added : global pandemic, and AI uprising. I mean take your pick - I don't know which one you think it's going to be. And it's a jolly thought isn't it? Talking about the end of the world.

And maybe you can see where I'm going with this, because Jesus, in this letter, actually *does* think that it's a jolly thought. Through His eyes, the end of the world is a great thing. And that's a slightly strange perspective. But, of course, that's what it's all about.	 

Because, in the heavenly perspective so far, we have already seen the throne at the centre of the universe. 
We've seen the risen Lamb ruling all creation from it. 
We've seen the dragon, Satan, struck down and defeated.
And we've seen how, now, he persecutes the Church on earth because his time is short.
But his time *is* short, and that's what we're going to read now. Look at 20v7 with me:

*"When the thousand years are over, [these thousand years are just a way of talking about the time that **we're in now**. The time between Jesus' resurrection, and His return, at the end of the world.],*

*[So when the thousand years are **over**, we are now talking about the future, we're talking about the end of the world] 
Satan will be released from his prison
[So Satan, in a sense, is currently restrained. Remember we read yesterday, he wants to destroy to the Church, but Jesus won't let him. So he's restrained; he's 'in prison'.]* 

*[So, when the thousand years are over, [,keep reading with me,]
Satan will be released from his prison]
and will go out to deceive the nations 
in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—*

*and to gather them for **battle**. 
In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
They marched across the breadth of the earth 
and surrounded the camp of God’s people, 
the city He loves. "*

So at the end of the world, the Devil will muster his armies to war against the people of God, one final battle. Guys, this is Avengers : Endgame. On one side, we have the dragon, and these nations called 'Gog and Magog' which, in the book of Ezekiel, were these nations that were hostile to Israel. But here they represent the universal group of people that oppose Christ. All people that oppose Jesus.

But then, on the other side, we have the camp of the people of God. And just picture it, all the armies of the earth gathered together against one small camp in the wilderness. It doesn't look very hopeful, does it? 

But, of course, as readers of Revelation, we know that the way things appear on earth is not the whole picture. What does Jesus see? Well just look at v9 : *" the camp of God’s people, 
**the city He loves**"*.  Because this pitiful camp is actually a city. 

We learnt yesterday that the woman fleeing in the wilderness is actually a heavenly princess. The persecuted Church on earth is actually victorious in heaven. And this camp is a city. Though it may look weak, in reality it is strong, and it is enduring, and it is *loved*. Did you see that? The God who sits on the throne loves this little camp. So what do you think it going to happen when its attacked? Well, we heard it read - God's fire of judgement comes down, and the dragon, and all of his followers, are destroyed. And the camp, the city of God's people, stands firm. Victory.

What is true in heaven will become true on earth, and Satan is now defeated not only in heaven, like in chapter 12, but *also* on earth.

But, as part of this, we've just got to take some to think about Hell. Because that's what Jesus shows us, in v15 that :

*"Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life [, anyone who hasn't been washed by the blood of the Lamb,] was thrown into the lake of fire."* with Satan.

Maybe some of us will have thought a lot about the idea of Hell before. Maybe for some of us this will be the first time hearing about it. Either way, I just want to say, it's a big topic, it's a serious topic.

And there will be plenty of time for questions after this, and obviously you can speak to your leaders anytime. And what I'm about to say is by no means the end of the conversation, but hopefully it'll help us to think about Hell as it's actually presented here in Revelation.

The world around us says to us that the reason why we exist, the reason for living, is to make ourselves happy. It's to find some sort of self-assurance or self-satisfaction, whatever that looks like. But if that's how we approach the world, if that's how we approach the idea of *Hell*, then of course it's going to sound unfair. 'Why does God have the right to punish *me* ? My life is my own, and I owe Him nothing'.

But actually we *know* why we exist. What's the shape of the universe? *Let them respond.*

Yeah, we heard it back in chapters 4 and 5. It's that circle centred on the throne, where the 24 elders and the 4 living creatures and all the angels of heaven and every created thing were *worshipping* God. And to have life *means* to join in with that worship. And so when we don't, when we excuse ourselves from those circles of praise, we're excusing ourselves from life. It's what we asked for.

'No thanks! I'll be alright on my own! I don't need any Lamb's blood'. Well God let's us go out on our own, and we find that, beyond the city of God, beyond the protection of Jesus' death on the cross, there is only destruction. 

But *that's* why Jesus, in His love, in His deep deep love, *longs* to show us this. Because it's a warning! These parts of the Bible aren't here to scare us, to frighten us into submission. They're here to warn us, to shake us awake - don't believe Satan's lies! Don't just go along with the world!

Okay, Revelation is a book of symbols, of images. But what Hell exactly looks like is sort of beside the point. The *image* is clear, the reality behind eternal seperation from God, eternal exclusion from those ranks of worshippers - it might as well be fire and sulphur and ashes.


But, as I said, let's keep the conversation going. I don't think that anyone, Christian or otherwise, finds the idea of Hell easy to think about. I mean, it is tragic. But, remember, it's also not the whole story.

Because after Satan has been thrown into the lake of fire, and after everyone who has rejected the Lamb is thrown there too, and all the forces of evil and chaos and rebellion have been done away with once and for all, John receives the final part of the vision. Look at 21v1 with me.

*"Then... I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea [And then v5]... He who was seated on the throne said, “[Behold,] I am making [all things] new!” "**

Because see after all the *weariness* of these thousand years fleeing and fighting Satan, suffering and sorrowing, *now* our Lord Jesus shall make everything new. 

Do you want to know why He's so excited about the end of the world? Look at 21v3:

*“Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, 
and He will dwell with them. 
They will be His people, 
and God Himself will be with them 
and be their God."*

Why should we be excited for the end of the world? I mean see it here. Because the end of the world does not mean everything stops existing. It's actually the *opposite*. Because God is now among His people, there is no longer any seperation between heaven and earth. The heavenly reality and the earthly reality, what Jesus sees and what we see, are now the same. The new heaven and the new earth, are the same place.

And what is it going to be like? Look at 21v4:

*"‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. 
There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, 
for the old order of things has passed away.”*

The big question for the Christians then, as it is us for us now, as it is for our sisters and brothers all over the world, is this : 'is it worth it?' Is it worth keeping on going with Jesus? 

It would be so much easier to give in to the world, to give in to the lie, to live through our own eyes -  it would be so much easier to do that. 

Following Jesus puts us in the Dragon's sights. We become one of his targets for the rest of our lives. But the clear answer to 'is it worth it?' is of course 'yes'! Look at 21v6 :

*"To the thirsty I will give water without cost [, our Father says,]
from the spring of the water of life. 
[And] those who are victorious will inherit all this, 
and I will be their God 
and they will be My children."*

Guys, of course it's worth it. Of course it's worth it.

There is a whole world to overcome. There are all the serpentine forces of darkness and malice and the sea to conquer. But if we refuse to compromise our faith, if we refuse to give up on the Lamb that was slain for *us*, that Lamb that now reigns from the centre of the universe -  then eternal victory is ours, and we shall drink *deeply* of those crystal waters of life.  We shall inherit all of these things. Jesus has paid for it with His own blood, He can offer us water *without cost*. He's the only One who can. We can go to no one else. 

And He's coming soon, we're told. Let us look to His return, and be ready, let us be awake, and be glad.
We've got a lot to look forward to.

Let's pray.
