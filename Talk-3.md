Good morning everyone!

Okay, so, we're in the final parts of Revelation

But I was just reflecting on what we've been looking at this weekend, and I was thinking that this is just so cool. Just think about it - we get to legitimately understand our lives in terms of mighty kings and queens, and thronerooms, and dragons, and great angelic battles. Maybe that can start to sound a bit childish. But I don't know! I think it's *thrilling*. 

It's shocking and rich and vibrant. And that's literally our lives! And it's all real.

But actually, and I should've already made this point by now.  But, actually, the book of Revelation needs to be vivid and colourful. It needs to shock us.

We've talked a lot about the heavenly perspective, but actually, what is the equivalent *earthly* perspective? Well, it's that everything's fine. Okay, there are ups and downs in life, but like we just sort of get on with it. And we can potter on through, trying to make the most of things. But, generally, things are fine, and we don't need to think too hard. And we definitely don't need to be so intense. But one of Satan's favourite lies to tell us is that how we spend our lives doesn't matter too much. It doesn't really matter what I do with my time, with my life. Just do whatever I want, really.

But *everything* we do, even the smallest of thoughts, is of *cosmic* significance.

Satan would try and convince us that nothing is happening, everything is business as usual - nothing's going on. But we're in the middle of a war. *The* war!

The images in Revelation are exciting, but they're also shocking. And they have to be shocking, because it can be so easy to sleepwalk through life. Just doing... whatever. And so Jesus, in this book, is shaking us awake. 'Open your eyes!', He calls to us, 'Wake up!'. We need to know what's true.

And, so far, we've seen the throne of God at the centre of the universe.
We've seen the risen Lamb ruling all creation from it.
We've seen how, as He died and rose from the dead, that dragon, Satan, was struck, and cast down to the earth, no longer able to accuse us of our guilt, because Jesus has washed it away.
And we've seen how, now that he knows he's lost the war, the Devil roams the earth attempting to persecute and destroy the Church - but God's protection, ultimately, is over His people in the wilderness.

This is what *is* true. And now, as we come into these final chapters of the Bible, we're going to see things that haven't quite happened yet, but they will. This is what will, inevitibalty, become true. 20v7:

*"When the thousand years are over, [these thousand years are another way of talking about the time that we are in now. A bit like the three and a half years or 1260 days from yesterday],*

*[But when the thousand years are over, so we're talking about the future now,] 
Satan will be released from his prison
[Satan, in a sense, is currently restrained. Remember we read yesterday, he wants to destroy to the Church, but Jesus won't let him. So he's restrained; he's in prison.]*

*[So, when the thousand years are over,
Satan will be released from his prison]
and will go out to deceive the nations 
in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—*

*and to gather them for **battle**. 
In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
They marched across the breadth of the earth 
and surrounded the camp of God’s people, 
the city He loves. "*

So, at the End of Days, the Devil, and the people that he has led astray, will muster themselves to war against the people of God, one final battle. Guys, this is Avengers : Endgame. On one side, we have the Dragon, and all those who align themselves with him. Here they're referred to as 'Gog and Magog' which were hostile nations, talked about in the book of Ezekiel. But here they represent the universal group of people that oppose Christ.

And then, on the other side, we have the camp of the people of God. And just picture it, all the armies of the earth gathered together against one small camp in the wilderness. It doesn't look hopeful. 

But, of course, as readers of Revelation, we know that the way things appear on earth is not the whole story. Because this pitiful camp is actually a city, it says in v9. We learnt yesterday that the ragged woman fleeing in the wilderness is actually a heavenly princess. The persecuted Church on earth is actually victorious in heaven. The Lamb that was slain is the Lion of Judah. And this camp is a city. Though it may look weak, in reality it is strong, it is enduring, and it is *loved*, it says here, by the God of all creation who sits on the throne. So what do you think it going to happen? Well, we heard it read - God's fire of judgement comes from heaven, and the Dragon, and all of his followers, are consumed. And the camp, the city, of God's people stands firm. Victory.

What is true in heaven will become true on earth, and Satan is now defeated not only in heaven, but also on earth. That scroll of Daniel is opening, and it cannot be stopped. God's promises are *here*.

But, as part of that, we've just got to take some to think about Hell. Maybe some of us will have thought a great deal before about the idea of eternal punishement. Maybe for some of us this will be the first time hearing about it. Either way, I just want to say, it's a big topic, it's a serious topic. Jesus talks about Hell a lot in the Gospels, He shows it to us here in these pictures of judgement before the throne in 20v11-15. We've got to deal with it. 

Just to say, there will be plenty of time for questions after this, and obviously you can speak to your leaders anytime. And what I'm about to say is by no means the end of the conversation, but hopefully it'll help us to think about Hell as it's actually presented here in Revelation.

The world around us says to us that the reason why we exist, the point of living, the point of existing, is to make ourselves happy. It's to find some sort of self-assurance or self-satisfaction. Our society tells us, that in one way or another, that we exist for ourselves, and what *we* decide is valuable. And if that's how we approach the world, if that's how we approach the idea of *Hell*, then of course it's going to sound terrible. 'Why does God have the right to punish *me*, or anyone else, for not obeying Him? My life is my own, and I owe Him nothing'.

But actually we *know* why we were created. We heard it back in chapters 4 and 5. Those concentric circles around the throne of God. The 24 elders and the 4 living creatures and all the angels of heaven and every created thing. What were they doing?

They were *worshipping* God. They were praising Him. Everything has been made to honour Him - we said that yesterday. To have life *means* to join in with that worship. And so when we don't, when we excuse ourselves from those circles of praise, we're excusing ourselves from the very reason for our existance. It's what we asked for.

'No thanks! I'll be alright on my own! I don't need any Lamb's blood'. Well God let's us go out on our own, and we find that, beyond the city of God, beyond the protection of Jesus' death on the cross, there is only oblivion. 

And so *that's* why Jesus, in His love, in His deep deep love, *longs* to show us this. Because it's a warning! These parts of the Bible aren't here to scare us, to frighten us into submission. They're here to warn us not to believe Satan's lies. They're here to warn us that when we align ourselves with the dragon, in the end, this is what it looks like, death and fire and sulphur. Okay, Revelation is a book of symbols, of images. But whether or not Hell is literally 'flames everywhere' is sort of beside the point. The *image* is clear, the reality behind eternal seperation from God, eternal exclusion from those ranks of worshippers, exclusion from the Lamb's book of life, written in His blood - it might as well be fire and ashes.

But, as I said, let's keep the conversation going. I don't think that anyone, Christian or otherwise, finds the idea of Hell easy to think about. I mean, it is tragic. But, remember, it's also not the whole story.

Because after Satan has been thrown into the lake of fire, and after everyone who has rejected the Lamb is thrown there too, and all the forces of evil and chaos and rebellion have been done away with once and for all, John receives the final part of the vision. ch21v1.

*"Then... I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea [you guys know what that means.  And then v5]... He who was seated on the throne said, “[Behold,] I am making [all things] new!” "**

In lots of ways, Revelation is not a happy book. It's full of dangers and warnings and horrible dragons and persecuted Christians and, we didn't read a lot of this, but also full of plagues and bloody wars and death and woe and you sort of just read it and think 'blimey, it just keeps going on and on and spiralling around and around into heavier and heavier things'.

But after all the weariness of these thousand years fleeing and fighting Satan, suffering and sorrowing, *now* our Lord Jesus shall make everything new. God's promises are *here*.

If we endure to the end, if we are victorious by the blood of the Lamb, and by holding to the testimony of Jesus, even to the point of physical death. By His resurrection our names are written in His book of life, then all the struggling will end just as He has promised. ch21v3:

*“Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, 
and He will dwell with them. 
They will be His people, 
and God Himself will be with them 
and be their God."*

And this is it. This is the moment when the heavenly reality and the earthly reality become one. Remember we were saying before it was a bit lke how we want to overlay the heavenly perspective over the earthly one? Well now they collapse into one another, and God's dwelling place will be with His people, unhindered, unrestained.

And what is it going to be like? ch21v4:

*"‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. 
There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, 
for the old order of things has passed away.”*

The big question for the Christians then, as it is us for us now, as it is for our sisters and brothers all over the world, is this : 'is it worth it?' Is it worth enduring? 

It would be so much easier to submit to the world, to give in to the lie, compromising with society -  these would be so much easier to do. 

Following Jesus means being enlisted for war, it puts us in the Dragon's sights. We become one of his targets for the rest of our lives. But the resounding answer to 'is it worth it?' is of course 'yes'.

*"To the thirsty I will give water without cost [, our Father says in v6,]
from the spring of the water of life. 
[And] those who are victorious will inherit all this, 
and I will be their God 
and they will be My children."*

Oh guys, of course it's worth it. Of course it's worth it.

There is a whole world to overcome. There are all the serpentine forces of darkness and malice and the sea to conquer. But if we refuse to compromise our faith, if we refuse to forsake the Lamb that was slain for *us*, that Lamb that now reigns from the centre of the universe - it's His world - then we shall drink *deeply* of those crystal waters of life.  We shall inherit all of these things. He has paid for it with His own blood, He can offer us water *without cost*. He's the only One who can. We can go to no one else. 

Jesus is coming soon, we're told. Let us look to that coming, and be ready, and be awake, and be glad.

Let's pray.
