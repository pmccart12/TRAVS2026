A princess and a dragon - it sounds like a fairytale! Think St. George or Perseus and Andromeda, or Sleeping Beauty... or Shrek. It's a fairytale! I mean, obviously there's a lot going on here, but if we start just by taking a step back and seeing that actually these images we're being given are not , they're not *strange* to us as humans. Whether you're in the East or the West, England or Russia or China, these pictures are familiar to us. And there's a reason why humans have always loved to tell each other stories of great big monsters, and beautiful royal maidens - it's because they're true. According to Revelation here, these myths and fairytales are *true*!

Because there really *is* a princess with heavenly beauty, and there really *is* a wicked dragon who wants to kill her, and eat her children, and there really is a St. George, a Knight who does what knights do best - slay dragons. But let's just get into it properly. Who are these characters in our fairy story, and why does Jesus want us to see this?

So we started with this woman, dressed in the sun and moon, and who has this crown with twelve stars. What do people think that could be? *Let people speak?*
What does the number twelve normally represent in the Bible? Yeah! The 'twelve tribes of Israel'. So this princess, is a sort of personification of Israel, of God's people. And, it says, that she *"cried out in pain as she was about to give birth"*. She's about to give birth.

And there's this dragon, with seven heads and a bunch of horns, and seven crowns. If you were paying attention, we actually do get told later on in v9 who this dragon is. It says it is *"that ancient serpent [, serprent from the Garden of Eden,] called the devil, or Satan"*. And Satan the Dragon, it says, *"swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth"*. And some people have different ideas about what this could mean. Can anyone remember from yesterday evening what 'stars' represented? *Let them speak*. Yeah, *angels*. The seven stars were the seven angels of the churches. And so some people think that this is talking about Satan leading a third of the angels in heaven to rebel against God, and this is where they fall. And I guess it could be that.

But actually we've got other stars even just in this passage right -  Princess Israel has a crown of stars, so maybe they could represent God's people? And if you go back to the book of Daniel, which we were thinking about this morning, and from which Revelation references a lot, it actually talks about this event. And, there, the stars are identified as the holy people of God. And so this sweeping of a third of the stars out of heaven to the earth is about Satan attacking God's people. And the point in Daniel, as I think it is here, is that this dragon... is strong. It says in Daniel that this dragon *"will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does"*. This is not just some push over - Satan really did tempt Adam and Eve to rebel against God. He really did sweep the stars out of heaven. And so we have this image of this Devil Serpent, with real power and, just like in every fairytale, he is *scary*. And now he turns his sights to the Child of this poor woman.

*"The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her Child the moment He was born."*
