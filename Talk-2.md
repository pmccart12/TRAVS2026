A princess and a dragon - it sounds like a fairytale! Think St. George or Perseus and Andromeda, or Sleeping Beauty... or Shrek. It's a fairytale! I mean, obviously there's a lot going on here, but if we start just by taking a step back and seeing that actually these images we're being given are not , they're not *strange* to us as humans. Whether you're in the East or the West, England or Russia or China, these pictures are familiar to us. And there's a reason why humans have always loved to tell each other stories of great big monsters, and beautiful royal maidens - it's because they're true. According to Revelation here, these myths and fairytales are *true*!

Because there really *is* a princess with heavenly beauty, and there really *is* a wicked dragon who wants to kill her, and eat her children, and there really is a St. George, a Knight who does what knights do best - slay dragons. But let's just get into it properly. Who are these characters in our fairy story, and why does Jesus want us to see this?

So we started with this woman, dressed in the sun and moon, and who has this crown with twelve stars. What do people think that could be? *Let people speak?*
What does the number twelve normally represent in the Bible? Yeah! The 'twelve tribes of Israel'. So this princess, is a sort of personification of Israel, of God's people. And, it says, that she *"cried out in pain as she was about to give birth"*. She's about to give birth.

And there's this dragon, with seven heads and a bunch of horns, and seven crowns. If you were paying attention, we actually do get told in v9 who this dragon is. It says *"that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan"*
