Good evening everyone!

Do you guys have a favourite story? Maybe like a book or a film?
I mean, there are lots of great stories, but what they all have in common, is that there's always a struggle. The best stories aren't the ones where everything is perfect all of the time, right? It's always that there is some problem or obstacle to overcome. Every story has a struggle.

And we're dashing through the story of Revelation. We've seen the Lamb on the throne, and now we've come to chapter 12.

We've already had it read, and we heard, in this new section of the letter, about some new heavenly images. Here they're referred to as 'signs', or symbols.

But, actually, I think we're already familiar with them. I mean, we have, in v1, a woman with a crown - so like a queen or a princess. And then, in v3, we've got a big red dragon.

A princess and a dragon - which just sounds like a fairy tale, right? Think St. George or Sleeping Beauty... or Shrek. It's a fairy tale! I mean, obviously there's a lot going on here, but this isn't anything unfamiliar!  People have always loved to tell each other tales of great big monsters, and beautiful royal maidens. But this story is real. Which is *awesome*. And so just, as we look at this passage, immerse yourself in these images, allow these characters to fill your imaginations. Just let it wash over you. Because this is a fairy tale worth listening to.

So, once upon a time, there was a woman, look back at v1, *"a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet [, radiant, heavenly splendour,] and a crown of twelve stars on her head"*. 
I reckon that, by now, we've done enough Revelation together whereby you guys can now start to work this out for yourselves. Who this could be? What do you think? There are no silly suggestions. *Let people speak?*

What does the number twelve normally represent in the Bible? Yeah! The 'twelve tribes of Israel'. So this princess, is a sort of heavenly personification of Israel, of God's people. And, it says, look at v2, that she *"cried out in pain [because] she was about to give birth"*. Princess Israel is about to have a child.

But then, once upon a time, look at v3, there was also *"an enormous red dragon... with seven heads and ten horns "*, which is a bit different to Shrek. But we're actually told in the text who this is, did anyone see? *Let them speak*
Yeah! We actually do get told later on in v9, look, that this dragon is *"that ancient serpent [, the serpent from the Garden of Eden,] called the devil, or Satan"*. And Satan the Dragon, it says, *"swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth"*. 

And we just heard what those stars were. Princess Israel has a crown of stars, so they're also associated with God's people. And so, big picture, the striking image we have is Satan, this great scarlet dragon, attacking and sweeping with his thick tail the people of God out of heaven.

And, all of a sudden, this is serious. This isn't Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon, all cuddly - because Satan really did tempt Adam and Eve to rebel against God. He really did lead the whole world astray. He really did sweep the stars out of heaven. And so we have this image of the Devil Serpent, who has real power. And he is *scary*. He's seriously scary. And now he turns his beady eyes to this poor woman. Look at v4:

*"...so that it might devour her Child the moment He was born."* 

But, of course, this Child is no ordinary child. Because this child is the Son, it says in v5, who will *"rule all the nations with an iron scepter"*. And that's a reference to Psalm 2, which is a psalm all about the royal Son of God. This is Jesus, right, Jesus who comes from the bloodline of Abraham, the line of King David, born of Princess Israel, and as we saw this morning, look at the end of v5 - despite Satan's attempts to destroy and devour Him, Becasue He rose from the dead, He now reigns from the throne of His Father. The *"Child was snatched up to God and to His throne"*.

And so now what happens?  Well look at v7:

War breaks out! And all the angels of God, led by the Archangel Michael, who we also hear about in the book of Daniel, they now take up arms against that Ancient Serpent and his demons. And they have a massive fight. But though perhaps once this dragon was strong and mighty, Jesus is now risen from the dead. He is victorious, remember. And so, v8, Satan is not strong enough. He who had swept the stars from heaven now himself is hurled down to the earth, and he is defeated.

See, because Satan's position in heaven, before, was to *accuse* the people of God. That's what it calls him in v10 if you look, *"the accuser [, the accuser,] of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night"*. 

Accusing us of all the guilt of all the ways in which we rebel against our Creator, how every day we do what is evil and wicked and ugly. Satan accuses us of our sin. And he had every right.

But *now*, now has come the salvation... and the power... and the kingdom of our God. We have triumphed over Satan it says, look at this in v11, just look at it and *treasure* these words. We have have victory over the dragon*by the blood of the Lamb*. That Lamb that sits on the throne at the centre of the universe. And Satan's power has been stripped away because he can no longer accuse us before God, for Jesus has bought us with His own blood. That's what that means, we have conquered *by the blood of the Lamb*, and we are made white as snow, and all of our sin - past, present, and future - is done away with. Satan is *no longer* able to accuse us.

And so Michael and his angels **strike** him down, and he falls, twisting and screaming and cursing - but in heaven he is defeated, and there is nothing that he can do. And what was lost to the serpent in the Garden of Eden is now, at Jesus's resurrection, it is *taken back*.

And **that's** reality through Jesus' eyes. The dragon is defeated. The end. 

Except not quite yet. There's more Jesus wants to show us, look at the end of v12 :

*"[Because the dragon, now,] is filled with fury,
 because he knows that his time is short.*

*[So] when the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth,
he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
...[now v15]
[And] from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, [it's that sea again isn't it, those waters of chaos,]
[the serpent spewed water like a river, ] to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent."*

The story's not finished. Satan couldn't destroy Christ, so now he's going to try and destroy Christ's people. This slithering crawling serpent now sets his seven sets of eyes on pursuing and overtaking and tearing apart the Church. Because every good story has a struggle. And the dragon now bellows torrents and tsunamis of dark water the he might drown us with all the demonic force that he can muster. 

And it's terrifying. And for so many Christians around the world this is so real. 
We have sisters and brothers in Nigeria right now, who are being macheted to death because of their faith. Their villages are being flattened, and their crops are being burned to the ground. And perhaps it just looks like the dragon is as powerful as he ever was.

We, in Cambridge, aren't at risk, really, of physical persecution, nothing even close. But maybe for us it looks more like that temptation to go along with the world around us. To give in as those waters of sin and self-gratification tug and pull at our feet. And then, when we do listen to the lies of our society, the serpent turns back around and accuses us. And the guilt is crushing. And has anything really changed?

But, again, the story is not finished.

Satan pursues and persecutes Jesus' people with all of his black fury, but just look at v14:

*"The woman [, the Church,] was given the two wings of a great eagle,
so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness,
where she would be taken care of..."*

Ultimately, we are taken care of. Our brothers and sisters in Nigeria are taken care of. No matter how much Satan flails and shrieks, his time is short. His final destruction is coming - we'll see that tomorrow.

He may be able to kill our bodies, he may try to crush us with the guilt of our sin. Every story has a struggle. But if we're in Christ, he is already defeated. That doesn't mean it's not hard now, but *this* is what is true.
If we've truly confessed Jesus as our Lord, then victory is ours. 

Did you see that in v11? Look at it :

*"[We] triumph over [Satan]
    by the blood of the Lamb....
    **and** by the word of [our] testimony;
they did not love their lives so much
    as to shrink from death."*

As we testify to our friends, our family, to the whole world around us, that Jesus is risen, that He is Lord of all on the throne, Satan is *crushed*. We've read enough fairy tales; we know how they end. And the dragon never wins. We've just got to hold on and keep going following Jesus. It can be so wearying sometimes - when the Devil hisses his lies at us, that it's not worth persevering in faith. But just ignore him, and remind yourself of what Jesus has shown us, because *that's* what is true. *That's* how the story ends.

Look at v10:

*"Now have come the salvation and the power
    and the kingdom of our God,
    and the authority of His Messiah."*

Let me pray.
