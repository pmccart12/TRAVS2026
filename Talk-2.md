So, we're back in Revelation, this book of symbols and images.

And Jesus showed us, this morning, that image of that throne up in heaven, the throne where all of reality gathers around to worship God, and to worship His Son. The Lamb who died but rose again to reign over the entire universe, and to bring His people into eternal life with Him.

And now, this evening, we are going to... skip a bunch of stuff. But chapter 12 opens a new section in the structure of Revelation - so it's a good place to skip to. /read rest in own time.

And we've already had it read, and we have, it says, in this new section, with some new heavenly images, these two 'signs', these two symbols. We have, first, this *"woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head."*. And then we also have this *"enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads"*".

But, actually, I think we're already familiar with these images. I mean, we have a woman with a crown, so like a queen or a princess. And then we've got a big red dragon.

A princess and a dragon - which just sounds like a fairytale, right? Think St. George or Sleeping Beauty... or Shrek. It's a fairytale! I mean, obviously there's a lot going on here, but if we start just by taking a step back and seeing that actually these pictures we're being given are not, they're not *completely* strange to us.  People have always loved to tell each other stories of great big monsters, and beautiful royal maidens. And so just, as we look at this passage, allow these pictures, these characters, to fill your imaginations. We want to immerse ourselves in that heavenly perspective, let it wash over you.

But anyway, we started with this woman, dressed in the sun and moon, radiant, heavenly splendour, and she has this crown of twelve stars. And I reckon we've done enough Revelation together whereby you guys can now start to work stuff out for yourselves. Who this could be? What do people think? *Let people speak?*
What does the number twelve normally represent in the Bible? Yeah! The 'twelve tribes of Israel'. So this princess, is a sort of heavenly personification of Israel, of God's people. And, it says, that she *"cried out in pain as she was about to give birth"*. Princess Israel is about to have a child.

But then there's also this dragon, with seven heads and a bunch of horns. And you guys get away with this one, because we're actually in the text who it is, did anyone see? *Let them speak*
Yeah! We actually do get told later on in v9 that this dragon is *"that ancient serpent [, the serpent from the Garden of Eden,] called the devil, or Satan"*. And Satan the Dragon, it says, *"swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth"*. 

And we just heard what those stars were. Princess Israel has a crown of stars, so they are also associated with God's people. And so, big picture, the striking image we have is Satan, this great scarlet dragon, attacking and sweeping with his thick tail the people of God out of heaven.

And, all of a sudden, this is serious. This isn't Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon, all cuddly - because Satan really did tempt Adam and Eve to rebel against God. He really did lead the whole world astray. He really did sweep the stars out of heaven. And so we have this image of this Devil Serpent, who has real power. And he is *scary*. He's seriously scary. And now he turns his beady eyes to this poor woman. v4:

*"...so that it might devour her Child the moment He was born."* 

But, of course, this Child is no ordinary child. Because this child is the Son who will *"rule all the nations with an iron scepter"*, it says. And that's a reference to Psalm 2, a psalm all about the Messiah, the Son of God. This is Jesus, right, Jesus who comes from the bloodline of Abraham, the royal line of King David, born of Princess Israel, and as we saw this morning, look at the end of v5 - despite Satan's attempts to destroy and devour Him, Becasue He rose from the dead, He now reigns from the throne of His Father. The *"Child was snatched up to God and to His throne"*.

And so now what happens?  v7:

Well, war breaks out in heaven, it says, and all the angels of God, led by the Archangel Michael, who we hear about in the book of Daniel, they now take up arms against that Ancient Serpent and his demons. And they have a massive fight. But though perhaps once this dragon was strong and mighty, Jesus is now risen from the dead. He is victorious, remember. And so, v8, Satan is not strong enough. He who had swept the stars from heaven now himself is hurled down to the earth, and he is defeated.

When we say that Satan was 'in heaven' before the resurrection, and now has been hurled down 'to earth' after, we're talking about *power* - heaven is where there is power. And Satan had a very particular kind of power.

See, Satan's position in heaven was to *accuse* the people of God. That's what it calls him in v10, *"the accuser [, the accuser,] of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night"*. 

Accusing us of all the guilt of all the ways in which we rebel against our Creator, in doing every day what was evil and wicked and ugly. Accusing us of our sin. And he had every right.

But *now*, now has come the salvation... and the power... and the kingdom of our God. We have triumphed over Satan it says, look at this in v11, just look at it and *treasure* these words. We have triumphed over the dragon*by the blood of the Lamb*. That Lamb that sits on the throne at the centre of the universe. And Satan's power has been stripped away because he can no longer accuse us before God, for Jesus has bought us with His own blood. That's what that means, we have conquered *by the blood of the Lamb*, and we are made white as snow, and all of our sin, past, present, and future, is done away with. Satan is *no longer* able to accuse us.

And so Michael and his angels **strike** him down, and he falls, twisting and screaming and cursing - but in heaven he is defeated, and there is nothing that he can do. And what was lost to the serpernt in the Garden of Eden is now, at Jesus's resurrection, it is *taken back*.

And that's the heavenly perspective. That's what is true. And Jesus really wants us to know it, end of v12 :

*"[Because the dragon, now,] is filled with fury,
 because he knows that his time is short.

[So] when the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth,
he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
...[now v15]
[And] from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, [it's that sea again, those waters of chaos,]
[the serpent spewed water like a river, ] to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent."*

Satan couldn't destroy Christ, so now he will try and destroy Christ's people. This slithering crawling serpent now sets his seven sets of eyes on pursuing and overtaking and consuming the Church. And he bellows torrents and tsunamis of dark water the he might drown us with all the demonic force that he can muster.

And that is terrifying. And for so many Christians around the world this is so real. 
We have sisters and brothers in Nigeria right now, who are being macheted to death because of their faith. Their villages are being flattened, and their crops are being burned to the ground. And perhaps it just looks like the dragon is as powerful as he ever was.

We, in Cambridge, aren't at risk, really, of physical persecution, nothing even close. But maybe for us it looks more like that temptation to compromise with the world around us. To give in as those waters of sin and self-gratification tug and pull at our feet. And then, when we do listen to the lies of our society, the serpent turns back around and accuses us. And the guilt is crushing. And has anything changed?

But that is not the heavenly perspective. Jesus wants us to know that that is *not* what is true. 

Satan pursues and persecutes us with all of his black fury, but just look at v14:

*"The woman [, the Church,] was given the two wings of a great eagle,
so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness,
where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time...
[now v16]
[And] the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth 
and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out..."*

Until Jesus returns, the Church will suffer. We're like this Princess, who is forced to flee into the wilderness. Which is the point, by the way, of this "time, times and half a time". It's the same as the 1260 days in v6 as well. 1260 days is about three and a half years (time, times, and half a time). But it's also 42 months, which is like the 42 odd years Israel spent wandering in the wilderness after fleeing Egypt into the desert. And the point is that in the desert, despite their grumbling, the Lord provided manna and quail and water for them. They were taken care of. 

And that's what Jesus tells us here. From a heavenly perspective we are taken care of. Our brothers and sisters in Nigeria have an untouchable hope. No matter how much Satan flails and shrieks, his time is short. And the eternal, the cosmic, the heavenly reality is that they have victory in Christ. That's what we were talking about this morning, wasn't it?

Satan may be able to kill our bodies, he may try to crush us with the guilt of our sin. But if we're in Christ, he is already defeated. Our murdered brothers and sisters will rise again. The shame we get from the world for following Jesus will one day blossom into eternal glory and honour. That doesn't mean it's not hard now, but *this* is what is true.

If we've truly confessed Jesus as our Lord, then victory is ours. Did you see that in v11?

*"[We] triumph over [Satan]
    by the blood of the Lamb....
    **and** by the word of [our] testimony;
they did not love their lives so much
    as to shrink from death."*

As we testify to our friends, our family, to the whole world around us, that Jesus is risen, that He is Lord of all on the throne, Satan is *crushed*. And our God takes care of us. And even as we die to ourselves, we are triumphant. But we've just got to hold on. We've got to hold on and keep going following Jesus. It can be so wearying sometimes. But when the dragon hisses his lies at us, that it's not worth persevering in Christ. Just ignore him, and remind yourself of the heavenly perspective. Because our Risen King gives us wings of refuge, and we are secure in heaven, and we can rest on Him for all the strength, all the comfort, we need. 

*"Now have come the salvation and the power
    and the kingdom of our God,
    and the authority of His Messiah."*

Let me pray.
