A princess and a dragon - it sounds like a fairytale! Think St. George or Perseus and Andromeda, or Sleeping Beauty... or Shrek. It's a fairytale right! I mean, obviously there's a lot going on here, but if we start just by taking a step back and seeing that actually these images we're being given are not , they're not *strange* to us as humans. Whether you're in the East or the West, England or Russia or China, these pictures are familiar to us. And there's a reason why humans have always loved to tell each other stories of great big monsters, and beautiful royal maidens - it's because they're true. According to Revelation here, these myths and fairytales are *true*!

Because there really *is* a princess with heavenly beauty, and there really *is* a wicked dragon who wants to kill her, and eat her children, and there really is a St. George, a Knight who does what knights do best - slaying dragons. But let's just get into it properly. Who are these characters in our fairy story, and why does Jesus want us to see this?

So we started with this woman, dressed in the sun and moon, and who has this crown of twelve stars. What do people think that could be? *Let people speak?*
What does the number twelve normally represent in the Bible? Yeah! The 'twelve tribes of Israel'. So this princess, is a sort of personification of Israel, of God's people. And, it says, that she *"cried out in pain as she was about to give birth"*. She's about to give birth.

And there's also this dragon, with seven heads and a bunch of horns, and seven crowns. If you were paying attention, we actually do get told later on in v9 who this dragon is. It says it is *"that ancient serpent [, the serpent from the Garden of Eden,] called the devil, or Satan"*. And Satan the Dragon, it says, *"swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth"*. 

Some people have different ideas about what this could mean. Can anyone remember from yesterday evening what 'stars' represented? *Let them speak*. Yeah, *angels*. The seven stars, in that chapter, were the seven angels of the churches. And so some people think that this is talking about Satan leading a third of the angels in heaven to rebel against God, and this is where they fall. And I guess it could be that.

But actually we've got other stars even just in this passage right -  Princess Israel has a crown of stars, so maybe they represent God's people? And if you go back to the book of Daniel, which we were thinking about this morning, and from which Revelation, we know, references a lot, it actually talks about this event. And, there, the stars are identified as the holy people of God. And so this sweeping of a third of the stars out of heaven to the earth is about Satan attacking God's people. And the point in Daniel, as I think it is here, is that this dragon... is strong. It says in Daniel that this dragon *"will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does"*. He's not just some push over - Satan really did tempt Adam and Eve to rebel against God. He really did sweep the stars out of heaven. And so we have this image of this Devil Serpent, with real power and, just like in every fairytale, he is *scary*. And now he turns his sights to the Child of this poor woman.

*"The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her Child the moment He was born."* But this Child is no ordinary child, we then discover. Because this child is the Son who will *"rule all the nations with an iron scepter"*, it says. And it's a reference to Psalm 2, a psalm all about the Messianic Son of God. This is Jesus, who comes from the bloodline of Abraham, born of Princess Israel, and as we saw this morning, look at the end of v5 - despite Satan's attempts to destroy and devour Him, He now reigns from the throne of God.

We'll come back to v6, but just jump with me to v7. Jesus has risen from the dead - and so now what happens to that enormous red dragon? Well, war breaks out in heaven, it says, and all the angels of God, led by the Archangel Michael, who we also hear about in Daniel, they now take up arms against that Ancient Serpent and his demons. But though perhaps once this dragon was strong and mighty, Jesus is now risen from the dead. He has triumphed. And so, v8, Satan is not strong enough. He who had swept the stars from heaven now himself is hurled down to earth. He is defeated.

And when we say that Satan was 'in heaven' before the resurrection, and now is 'on earth' after, we're not talking about his fall from being a 'good angel', so to speak. Rather, here, it means that - heaven is where there is power. And Satan had a very particular kind of power. Let me just read from v10 :

*"**Now** have come the salvation and the power
    and the kingdom of our God,
    and the authority of His Messiah.
For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,
    who accuses them before our God day and night,
    has been hurled down.
They triumphed over him
    by the blood of the Lamb
    and by the word of their testimony"*
 
Satan's position in heaven was to *accuse* the people of God. What was the power he had over us? It was that we were sinners, we were *able* to be accused day and night. Accused of all the guilt of all the ways in which we'd joined in with that dragon, in rebelling against our Creator, in doing what was evil and wicked and ugly.

But *now* has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, why? Because *we* have triumphed over Satan, how? It says, look at this in v11, just look at it and *treasure* these words. We have triumphed over the dragon *by the blood of the Lamb*. That Lamb at the centre of the universe. Satan's power has been stripped away because he can no longer accuse us before God, for Jesus has bought us with His own blood, and we are made white as snow, and all of our sin, past, present, and future, is washed away.

So Michael and his angels **strike** Satan down, and he falls, twisting and screaming and cursing - but in heaven he is defeated, and there is nothing he can do. So what then *is* the issue?
