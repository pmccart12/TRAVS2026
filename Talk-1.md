Good morning everyone!

How well do you think you could draw the outline of the UK from memory?
I reckon I'd do alright! I don't know about you.
But a newspaper asked over a hundred British people to try and do this, and these were some of the results. Which one is best do you think? [show slide]. They're all pretty terrible aren't they. But what about this one?
[show slide]
Come on, that is pretty bad! You'd think, you spend your whole life living in the UK, and you think *that's* what it looks like! It's silly.

But actually, we're going to see that this is sort of what we do. Because the entire universe has a shape, and we're not always great at remembering what it is.

But I'll explain what I mean by that in a moment, for now  let's just start. Look at 4v2 with me:

*"At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with Someone sitting on it. And the One who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne."*

So we're back looking at the world through Jesus' eyes, and He takes us up to His Father in heaven. And this is the beautiful, the glorious, God of everything, Who shines like precious stones, and He's sitting above His creation, ruling it from His throne.

*"[And] surrounding [this] throne [, look at v4,] were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.*"

Remember we were saying that, in Revelation, numbers are symbolic. And a bit later on in the letter, the idea of 24 is shown to symbolise the 12 tribes of Israel, plus the 12 disciples. In total, the 24 elders represent the people of God, old and new testaments. But let's keep going. 4v5:

*"From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. [It's like Mount Sinai.] In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the Seven Spirits of God. [remember the number 7? Fulness ; this is the fulness of the Holy Spirit.] Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal."*

And this sea sounds kind of nice right, it's "clear as crystal" - it lovely, a trip to the Norfolk coast, or the Bahamas. But actually, in the Bible, and in the Old Testament especially, the sea was not a good thing. Before God made the world, what was there? It says in Genesis 1 that the Spirit of God was hovering over ...the waters, these sort of 'chaos waters'. And out of them God brought order and light, but the water itself represented, well, disorder, darkness. Or think about the Red Sea, or Noah's flood, or Jonah and the whale, I'm sure there are more examples. Generally, the idea is that sea, the ocean, symbolically is opposed to God and His people. This is why, when Jesus calms the storm, it's more than just Him demonstrating His power over nature - He's demonstrating His power, as well, over evil and chaos and Satan.

But obviously the sea, here, in Revelation, is pretty chill - it doesn't seem very scary. But I think that that's actually the point. Because remember this is the world thorugh Jesus' eyes. Perhaps down on earth the sea seems to be raging and stirring - Satan is pretty scary. But, from heaven, the sea is tame and, crucially, under control. The sea is calm. And the God on the throne is Lord over all things, even that which is in complete opposition to Him. He reigns from the throne.

And also around the throne, it says in v6, there are these 'living creatures'. And I'd love to talk more about them, but sadly there's no time. Because we've looked at lots of details, but I think we've just got to step back for a moment. 

We've got all these different things up in heaven, rainbows and oceans and elders and living creatures, but did you notice the *shape* they're in? 4v3, the rainbow *encircles* the throne. Or v4, the elders are *surrounding* the throne, end of v6, the living creatures were *in the centre, around the throne*. Through Jesus' eyes, in His heavenly perspective, the entire universe... is organised in circles. And, at the centre of those concentric circles, is the throne of God. The shape of the universe is a circle.

But what does that even mean? Just look at 4v8 :

*"[Everyone's in circles, and] day and night they never stop saying: “‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ Who was, and is, and is to come...”*

*"[v10]...They lay their crowns before the throne and say: “You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honour and power, **for You created all things**, and by Your will they were created and have their being.”"*

Because God is the Creator of all things - He made us - He is worthy of our praise. And so all creation encircles Him in order to **worship** Him.

And now you'd think that a circle is a lot easier to remember than the complicated outline of the UK, but we forget it all the time.

Society will tell us that, you know, we come up with our own purpose. We get to decide why we think we exist, and that's personal to me, it's my own business. But actually that's wrong, because everything, **everything** exists to worship and to **adore** the beautiful God who created all things. All creation is a circle, because all creation has been designed to worship. And so, if we're not joining those circles of worship, we're missing the point of like all reality. We forget the shape of the universe. And we're missing out on the thing we literally exist for. 



Because there's something else we've not seen yet. There's a bit of commotion, there's something going on in the middle of the circle. Look at 5v1 with me:

*"Then I saw in the right hand of Him [, the Father,] who sat on the throne [at the centre of the universe] a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. "*

Okay, so now we've got this scroll. And we're going to need our Old Testaments handy, because this scroll is from the book of Daniel. In chapter 12, right at the end, God has just given Daniel a vision of the future, and then He says to him :

*"But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end....and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."*

Fullstop. And that's how the book of Daniel ends, with this hope of an inheritance, the hope of eternal life with God, but also a command to wait. And so this sealed scroll, in a word, contains all that hope.

And so a mighty angel calls out, look at 5v2 with me, and says *"Who is worthy to break the [seven] seals and open the scroll?"*  Who is able to bring about the promises of God, life for His people?. But nobody could be found. And so John weeps and weeps. Because the question is - will those promisies of God ever come? Follow along with me from v5 :

*"[But] then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, [Jesus, **He**] has triumphed. **He** is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”*

*Then I saw[...] a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the centre of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the [24] elders....[now v7]

*[And] He went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. And when He had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb...And [, it says, v9,] they sang a new song"*

A new song. Something new is happening in heaven, something that has not happened before.

*"And they sang a new song, [v9 still,] saying:

“You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, 
[**You** are worthy to bring about the promises of God] 
**because You were slain**, and with Your blood You purchased for God 
persons from every tribe and language and people and nation."*

Because You were slain. Because God Himself came down, and died on a cross, and rose to resurrection life, and rose to His throne in heaven, there is a new age. And all the promises of God that Daniel and Israel and the whole world were longing for in that scroll - all the hopes that humanity has ever had since we were cast out of the Garden of Eden, hope for *new life* - well, the Lamb is worthy to open the scroll, the seals are being broken, because at the cross, and at the resurrection something new has begun.


You know, I think we actually do know what the shape of the universe is. I think that everyone in our society *does* understand that it's a circle. But it's a circle centred on the wrong thing. Our lives get so filled up with so many things. Maybe it can feel like the centre of the universe is, I don't know, exam grades, or friendships, climate change or... me, and whatever I want. But what is the centre? What is everything else in all reality orbiting around?

We're all standing centred on one thing - on the throne of the Lamb. On the God who died on a cross.

And there's so much that could be said about this. 

What does the kingdom of God actually look like? What does victory for the follower of Jesus mean? In heaven, we see here, it looks like thrones and crowns and glory - but on earth, we know, it will probably look different. And it probably won't look like power and influence and popularity. And it may very well end up looking like a Lamb, hanging on a cross.

But that's the God we were created to worship, then I think it's going to end alright.

Let's pray.
