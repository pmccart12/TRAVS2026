Good morning everyone! 

Okay, so! Revelation! 

We were talking yesterday about how Revelation is about *worldview*, what is the lens through which we interpret the world around us? And there's lots going on in the world around us right now!

What is it in our worldview that needs to be corrected, that needs to be reshaped by this book?

I actually think we should just start, and read it, and see what Jesus, as He gives this vison to John, thinks we need to know, and see. And, just to say, it's going to be a bit a of hefty one this morning, we're entering into Jesus' visionary world for the first time. Over the next few days, the plan is for us to become more and more immersed in the symbols and images He uses, but we've just got to start. So, look down with me to chapter 4v1 :

"*After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”*

*At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. And the One who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne."*

Jesus takes us up to the heavenly throne of God. And we know that it's God because of how He's described : jasper and ruby, rainbows and emeralds. This is the beautiful, the glorious, God of everything, and He's sitting above His creation, ruling it from His throne.

*[And] surrounding [this] throne [, verse 4,] were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.*

Remember, we're thinking in terms images, figures, symbols, numbers are symbolic in Revelation, nothing is random. And a bit later on in Revelation, in chapter 21, the idea of 24 is shown to symbolise the 12 tribes of Israel, plus the 12 apostles. In total, the 24 elders represent the people of God, old and new testaments. Or, at least, a sort of heavenly representation of the people of God. But anyway, let's keep going. 4v5:

*From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing.* without looking at the next line can anyone remember what the seven lamps meant from last night? Yeah haha.

*These are the Seven Spirits of God. [the fullness of the Holy Spirit.] Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.*

And I think it's going to be worth just spending some time on this 'sea', because we'll definitely be coming back to it.

Now, this sounds kind of nice right, it's "clear as crystal" - it sounds lovely, a trip to the Norfolk coast, or the Bahamas. But actually, in the Bible, in the Old Testament especially, the sea was not a good thing. Before God made the world, what was there? It says in Genesis 1 that the Spirit of God was hovering over something- can anyone remember what it was? Yeah! It was the waters, these sort of 'chaos waters'. And out of them God brought order and light, but they themselves represented, well, disorder, darkness. Or think about the Red Sea, the great obstacle opposing the freedom of God's people as they fled Egypt. Or even Noah's flood, or Jonah and the whale, I'm sure there are more examples. Generally, the sea, the ocean, stands *against* God and His people, symbolically. This is why, when Jesus calms the storm, it's more than just Him demonstrating His power over nature - He's demonstrating His power, as well, over evil and chaos and Satan.

But obviously the sea, here, looks calm. And I think that this is the idea : we're being given a worldview, a heavenly perspective. Perhaps down on earth the sea seems to be raging and stirring - Satan is going nuts. But, from heaven, it's tame, and under control. The seething oceans of everything that is corrupt... are under God's control. The sea is calm. And we'll think more about that this evening but, for now, let's keep going.

So, we're building up this picture of the heavenly throne of God, who is at the centre of everything. We've got the people of God, these 24 elders, the Holy Spirit, the Seven Spirits, the sea, and now, it says, in v6, we have, around the throne, these 'living creatures'. There are four of them, each with a different animal head, and they've got loads of eyes covering them, and a bunch of wings. Obviously they're kind of freaky. We don't have loads of time to explain everything going on here, but, just know that these are angels, heavenly servants of God. These are angels.

And they're surrounding this throne at the centre of the universe, along with the twenty four elders. The angels and the people of God encircling Him, worshipping* Him. Look at 4v8 :

*"Day and night they never stop saying:
“‘Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord God Almighty,’
Who was, and is, and is to come....”*

*[v10]...They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
“You are worthy, our Lord and God,
    to receive glory and honor and power,
for You created all things,
    and by Your will they were created
    and have their being.”"*

Because God is the Creator of all things, He is worthy of our praise. All creation encircles Him to *worship*. And so, if we're not joining in with that worship, we're missing the point of like *everything*. We're missing the point. In this worldview, *everything* exists to worship God. And we'll come back to this idea in a moment, but there's actually something else John needs to see first, becasuse the vision continues, 5v1 :

*"Then I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne [God] a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. "*

Okay, so now we've got this scroll. What is it? This is when having our Old Testaments out is essential? Don't worry about turning there, but I'll just read it out, last chapter of Daniel, chapter 12 :

God has just given Daniel a vision of the End Times, and then He says to him :

*"But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end....As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."*

Fullstop. And that's how the book of Daniel ends, with the hope of an inheritance, the hope of eternal life, but a command to wait. And this sealed scroll, in a word, contains all that hope. The hope of all the promises of God, to judge evil, and to bless and bring life to His people. All Israel's hope is contained within that scroll. Back to Revelation, 5v2 :

*"And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” [in other words, who is able to bring about the promises of God, life for His people?] But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside."*

John weeps. because the question is - will those promises of God ever come? Will His people ever receive their inhertance of life?

*"[But] Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, [this is Jesus, **He**] has triumphed. **He** is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”*

*Then I saw[...] a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the centre of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the [24] elders. The Lamb had seven horns [symbolising strength] and seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God [, the Holy Spirit,] sent out into all the earth.*

*He went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne [, the Father]. And when He had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb...And [, it says, v9,] they sang a new song"*

A *new* song. Something *new* is happening in heaven, something that hasn't happened before.

*"And they sang a new song, saying:*

*“You are worthy to take the scroll
    and to open its seals,
    [**You** are worthy to bring about the promises of God]
**because You were slain,**
    and with Your blood You purchased for God
    persons from every tribe and language and people and nation."*

Because You were *slain*. Because God Himself came down, and died on a cross, and rose to resurrection life, and rose to heaven, there is now a new age. And we're in that age. If we live after the cross, after the resurrection, then all the promises of God that Daniel and Israel and the whole world were longing for in that scroll - all the hopes that humanity has ever had since we were cast out of the Garden of Eden, hope for new life - well, the Lamb is worthy to open the scroll, the seals are being broken, because at the cross, and at the resurrection something new has begun.

Daniel was looking toward, longing for, the 'End Times'. But, according to Revelation, they've already begun. We're in the End Times now, the future is now, because Jesus is already risen.

So what do struggling Christians need to know now? 
God's promises are here. At the resurrection Jesus comes before that glorious throne of God, and He takes His place on it. And He reigns from heaven.

Because what is at the centre of the universe? Our lives get so filled up with so many things. Maybe it can feel like the centre of the universe is, I don't know, exam grades, or friendships, climate change or AI or whatever. But what *is* the centre? What is everything else in all reality orbiting around? 5v13 :

*"Then I heard **every** creature 
in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying:

“To Him Who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
    be praise and honour and glory and power,
for ever and ever!”"*

Every creature in the world, the four living creatures, the 24 elders, we're all standing around, centred on one thing - on the throne of the Lamb.

What is at the centre of the universe? It is a God who died on a cross.



\\ Maybe we get disheartened about the sacrifices that we have to make as Christians. 

Feeling weird when we tell our friends we go to church. Or we force ourselves to show restraint and self-control, when everyone else just does what they want with gossip and alcohol and porn and TikTok. It's a sacrifice, in a sense, to restrain ourselves. And the Christian life always involves sacrifice of some kind. We have many sisters and brothers all over the world right now who are consciously preparing to die because they know that that's where following Jesus will lead them. But He wants them to know, and us to know, this - that at the centre of everything there is a God who sacrificed Himself on a cross for His people, but it lead to glory, and to honour, and to life.


 Are we joining in with that worship?
 
 And *now*, because He rose from the dead, He is reigning. He has undisputed power over everything. We're going to see this evening how this especially means that Satan's power over us is no more but, for now, just hold that image in your mind. Remember, the whole reason why we're given all these pictures and symbols in Revelation is **so that** we can hold them in our minds. Maybe we should all close our eyes, just for a moment (okay kind of cringe but just bear with me).

Visualise in your head, however you do, that throne. That thone that sits at the centre of reality. And on that throne, details are blurry, but there is a beautiful God, like jasper and ruby and emerald, and there is a crystal ocean before Him, and all the evil powers cannot shake the fact that He is in control and He is good. And there is also a Lamb, there is a Lamb with a bloody wound on His side, but somehow He is strong. And He stands, no longer in weakness, but in power, and around Him, and around the throne, are angels, and angels and so many angels, and twenty four shining people, with golden crowns and dressed in white, and we're all worshipping this Lamb, and this is why we were made.

Guys are we joining in with that worship? (You can open your eyes).
Are we joining in with that worship?
Do we live, do we act, do we speak, do we think as if the centre of the universe really is this God, becasue, it is?
We know what it looks like right?
Fighting sin, and Satan, and believing and trusting and loving that God.
I know I wish my life looked more like that.
Because it really is true.

That throne is  more real than anything else around us right now. Becasue when the End Times conclude, and the seventh and final seal of that scroll is broken, this room will pass away. But that throne will remain, and it will grow bigger, and more solid than anything we can comprehend. And it will be wonderful, when heaven and earth are reunited. Tomorrow morning we're going to think a lot more about that throne, and about the Lamb on it, but let's leave it there for now. Jesus reigns in heaven, let me pray quickly.
