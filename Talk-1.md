Good morning everyone! 

- wry comment about sleep idk?

Okay, anyway! Revelation! 

We were talking yesterday about how Jesus is unveiling to us His heavenly perspective. This is it. v1, the door has been opened, the voice has called, and John has entered in. v2 :

*"At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. And the One who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne."*

Jesus takes us up to His Father in heaven. And this is the beautiful, the glorious, God of everything, Who shines like precious stones, and He's sitting above His creation, ruling it from His throne.

*[And] surrounding [this] throne [, v4,] were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.*

Remember, we're thinking in terms images, figures, symbols. And numbers are symbolic in Revelation, as you might expect. And a bit later on in the letter, the idea of 24 is shown to symbolise the 12 tribes of Israel, plus the 12 apostles. In total, the 24 elders represent the people of God, old and new testaments. And this is a sort of heavenly representation of them - well, of us! Of the people of God. Let's keep going. 4v5:

*From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. [It's like Mount Sinai.] In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the Seven Spirits of God. [the fulness of the Holy Spirit.] Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.*

So we're building up this image, right. The throne of the beautful God, surrounded by the people of God, reigning with Him. And the Holy Spirit of God fills the heavens, and then there's this sea of glass.

And I think it's going to be worth just spending some time on this 'sea', because we'll definitely be coming back to it.

And it sounds kind of nice right, it's "clear as crystal" - it lovely, a trip to the Norfolk coast, or the Bahamas. But actually, in the Bible, in the Old Testament especially, the sea was not a good thing. Before God made the world, what was there? It says in Genesis 1 that the Spirit of God was hovering over something-  does anyone know what it was off the top of their heads? *Let them respond.* // sounds patronising>> ??

Yeah! It was the waters, these sort of 'chaos waters'. And out of them God brought order and light, but they themselves represented, well, disorder, darkness. Or think about the Red Sea, the great obstacle opposing the freedom of God's people as they fled Egypt. Or, of course, Noah's flood, or Jonah and the whale, I'm sure there are more examples. Generally, the idea is that sea, the ocean, symboolically stands *against* God and His people. This is why, when Jesus calms the storm, it's more than just Him demonstrating His power over nature - He's demonstrating His power, as well, over evil and chaos and Satan.

And obviously the sea, here, is calm - it doesn't seem very scary. But I think that that's actually the point. We're being given a heavenly perspective. Perhaps down on earth the sea seems to be raging and stirring - Satan is writhing and terrorising. But, from heaven, the sea is tame and, crucially, under control. The seething oceans of everything that is corrupt... are under God's control - the sea is calm. And the God on the throne is Lord over all things, even that which is in complete opposition to Him. He reigns from the throne.

// transition 
So, 24 elders,  sea, and now, it says, in v6, around the throne, there are also these 'living creatures'. And there are four of them, each with a different animal head, and they've got loads of eyes covering them, and a bunch of wings. Obviously they're kind of freaky. But again, we're trying to immerse ourselves in Jesus' visual language, even when it's a bit weird. They've got wings and eyes, which is how *angels* are often described in the Old Testament, spiritual servants of God. And then their heads - notice they cover every major animal group - predators and birds and field animals and, of course, people as well. So these angels represent the fulness of God's creatures. And so we've got the angels and the people of God and all His creation encircling Him, *worshipping* Him. Look at 4v8 :

*"Day and night they never stop saying:
“‘Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord God Almighty,’
Who was, and is, and is to come...”*

*[v10]...They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
“You are worthy, our Lord and God,
    to receive glory and honour and power,
for You created all things,
    and by Your will they were created
    and have their being.”"*

Because God is the Creator of all things, He is worthy of our praise. All creation encircles Him to *worship*. 

Society will tell us that, you know, we come up with our own purpose. We get to decide why we think we exist, and that's personal to me, it's my own business. But actually I'm wrong, because everything, *everything* exists to worship and to *adore* the beautiful God who created all things. And so, if we're not joining in with that worship, we're missing the point of like *all reality*. And we're missing out on the thing we literally exist for. It can be tempting to live for whatever we feel we want, but it will never bring us satisfaction. 

I think we generally know what that looks like. It means that every word we speak, and every thought we think, and every movement of our hands, is done for His sake. We put His ways first. We fight sin, and we live our entire lives seeking *His* will, and His glory.

We've got to join to in with that worship, and we will be more ourselves than we've ever been.



5v1:

*"Then I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne [, the Father,] a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. "*

// flow 
Okay, so now we've got this scroll. And again, we need our Old Testaments handy, last chapter of Daniel, chapter 12, don't worry about turning there :

God has just given Daniel a vision of the End Times, and then He says to him :

*"But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end....As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."*

Fullstop. And that's how the book of Daniel ends, with this hope of an inheritance, the hope of eternal life with God, but a command to wait. And so this sealed scroll, in a word, contains all that hope. The hope of all the promises of God, to judge evil, and to bless and bring life to His people. All the world's hope is contained within that scroll.

And so a mighty angel calls out 'Who is worthy to break the seven seals and open the scroll? Who is able to bring about the promises of God, life for His people?'. But nobody could be found. And so John weeps and weeps. Because the question is - will those promisies of God ever come?

*"[But] then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, [Jesus, **He**] has triumphed. **He** is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”*

*Then I saw[...] a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the centre of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the [24] elders. The Lamb had seven horns [symbolising strength] and seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God [, the Holy Spirit,] sent out into all the earth.*

*He went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne [, His Father]. And when He had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb...And [, it says, v9,] they sang a new song"*

A *new* song. Something *new* is happening in heaven, something that has not happened before.

*"And they sang a new song, saying:*

*“You are worthy to take the scroll
    and to open its seals,
    [**You** are worthy to bring about the promises of God]
**because You were slain,**
    and with Your blood You purchased for God
    persons from every tribe and language and people and nation."*

Because You were *slain*. Because God Himself came down, and died on a cross, and rose to resurrection life, and rose to heaven, there is a new age. And we're in that age now. If we live after the cross, after the resurrection, then all the promises of God that Daniel and Israel and the whole world were longing for in that scroll - all the hopes that humanity has ever had since we were cast out of the Garden of Eden, hope for new life - well, the Lamb is worthy to open the scroll, the seals are being broken, because at the cross, and at the resurrection something *new* has begun.

Daniel was looking toward, longing for, the 'End Times'. But, according to Revelation, they've already begun. We're in the End Times now, because Jesus is already risen, and He reigns from heaven, on that throne at the centre of the universe. Our lives get so filled up with so many things. Maybe it can feel like the centre of the universe is, I don't know, exam grades, or friendships, climate change or AI or whatever. But what *is* the centre? What is everything else in all reality orbiting around? 

5v13, we see that every creature in the world, the four living creatures, the 24 elders, we're all standing around, centred on one thing - on the throne of the Lamb. On the God who died on a cross.

And there's *so* much that could be said about this. But just look back at 3v21 with me quickly. This is the end of the seventh letter to the churches. This is what Jesus says :

*"To the one who is victorious, 
I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne, 
just as I was victorious 
and sat down with My Father 
on His throne.

Whoever has ears, 
let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”*

The question which we're going to leave partly hanging for now and, hopefully, answer this evening is this : what does it mean to be 'victorious'? 

*"To the one who is victorious, 
I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne"*

Because that's what it's about, right? Victory. Everyone loves to win - just wait for boardgames later. But if we are to be victorious just as Jesus was victorious, that's what it says, just at the Lamb that was slain was victorious, then I don't think it will be what the world expects. 

What *does* the kingdom of God actually look like? What *does* victory for the follower of Jesus mean? In heaven, we see here, it looks like thrones and crowns and glory - but on earth, we know, it will probably look different. And it probably won't look like power and influence. And it may very well end up looking like a Lamb, hanging on a cross.

But we're running out of time.

So, to wrap up, the heavenly perspective.

Jesus has risen from the dead, He has opened the scroll. He now reigns in heaven, and all creation gathers round to worship Him, and to worship His Father.

We were created to join in with that worship. To worship Him with all of our lives, in everything we do, in every word we speak, in every thought we think.

But, unbelievably, we are also invited to join Him. Not just on a throne next to Him, that's not what He says.

*"I will give the right to sit with Me **on My throne**"*.

On *His* throne. We are not worthy. But He died for us. And He *is* worthy. And so now all these things, in Him, will be ours also.

Let me pray.
